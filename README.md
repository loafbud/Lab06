# Lab06
This lab builds on what you already know about interrupts, but we’re leaving assembly language behind and moving on to C. And while C is quite different than AVR assembly, by using the predefined #include files in Atmel Studio you’ll be able to access the internal hardware features of the ATmega128A in a very intuitive and familiar way. The goal of this lab is to create several "flashing patterns" using eight LEDs attached to the ReadyAVR board, and to then use the on-board joystick's center pushbutton to switch between those patterns.

Have fun!
